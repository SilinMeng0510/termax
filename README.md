Termax is an LLM agent in your terminal that converts natural language to commands.

- üß© Shell Extensions: Plugin with popular shells like `zsh`, `bash` and `fish`.

## Installation

pip install termax
```

## Quick Start

After installation, you'll need to configure the LLM. A setup guide will automatically launch the first time you use Termax. Alternatively, you can manually initiate configuration at any time by running `t config` or `termax config`.

#### Ask Commands

You can start using Termax by asking using command `t` or `termax`:

```bash
t show me the top-5 CPU processes
```

#### Guess Commands (experimental)

Termax can predict your next move based on your command history‚Äîjust try t guess or termax guess to generate a suggested command. It's not only smart, it's fun!

```bash
t guess
```


## Plugin

We support various shells like `bash`, `zsh` and `fish`. You can choose to install the plugins by

t install -n <plugin>
```

The `<plugin>` can be any of `zsh`, `bash`, or `fish`. With this plugin, you can directly convert natural language into commands using the Ctrl + K shortcut.

You can also easily uninstall the plugin by
